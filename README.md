We propose Stochastic Block Influence model to study the effect of social influence, in which individuals’ adoption decisions are influenced by others in the network. Inspired by the Stochastic Block model, we assume that there are hidden social blocks in a community and an individual in the community is allowed to proportionally belong to multiple blocks. 

We test our model on the micro-finance adoptions in Indian villages. We use different Bayesian inference techniques to uncover individual block membership and block-to-block influence. These features are shown to be effective in predicting villagers’ adoption of a microfinance product.
